## Overview

This repository hosts a **smart Energy Management System (EMS)** developed for a **university campus in Kenya** to improve on-site solar energy utilization through **day-ahead solar forecasting and intelligent load scheduling**.

The system integrates a **machine learning–based solar energy prediction model** with a **heuristic load scheduling algorithm** to align controllable electrical loads with periods of high solar photovoltaic (PV) generation. 
An interactive **Streamlit web dashboard** is used to visualize forecasts, energy production, and optimized load schedules.

The project demonstrates how data-driven energy management can increase **solar self-consumption**, reduce dependency on grid electricity, and support institutional sustainability goals.


## Project Objectives

i.) To Forecast next-day solar energy production using **machine learning (XGBoost)** and meteorological data.

ii.) To Optimize scheduling of **controllable campus loads** to coincide with peak solar availability.

iii.) To improve on-site **solar PV self-consumption** and reduce energy export to the grid.

iv.) To provide a **user-friendly dashboard** for operational decision-making.


## System Architecture

The EMS consists of four main components:

### 1. A Solar Forecasting Module

* This module uses **XGBoost model** to predict next-day PV energy production.
* It is trained on historical irradiance, weather, and PV output data.
* The meteorological inputs are sourced via the **Open-Meteo API**.
* The module outputs **30-minute resolution forecasts** for 24 hours ahead.

### 2. Load Modelling

* Campus electrical demand were split into:

  1.  **Base load** (non-deferrable: lighting, ICT, essential services)
  2.  **Controllable loads** These include deferrable appliances such as laundry machines, dryers, dishwashers, ovens, water heaters, and ventilation.

### 3. Load Scheduling Algorithm

* A **heuristic-based scheduler** prioritizes running controllable loads during periods of high forecasted solar production.
* It Enforces realistic operational constraints, including:

  i.) Daylight-only operation (06:00–18:00)
  
  ii.) Contiguous runtime for appliances

  iii.) Device-specific time windows for example ovens finishing before midday.
* The algorithim is designed for **transparency, low computational cost, and practical deployment**

### 4. A Simple Streamlit Dashboard

* This dashboard Visualizes:

  1.  Next-day irradiance forecast.
  2.  Predicted solar energy production.
  3.  Optimized load schedule in a Gantt-style timeline.
* This dashboard could enable energy managers to understand and anticipate energy flows before the operating day


##  Technologies Used

1.  **Python**
2.  **XGBoost** machine learning model.
3.  **Pandas & NumPy** for data processing.
4.  **Streamlit** for a simple web dashboard.
5.  **Plotly** for interactive visualizations.
6.  **Open-Meteo API** to access weather & irradiance forecasts.
